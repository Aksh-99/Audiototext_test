# Audiototext_test
# Speech-to-Text Conversion

## Introduction

Speech-to-Text (STT) conversion is an interesting natural language processing task that recognizes and translates spoken language into written text. This project uses the SpeechRecognition library to perform speech-to-text conversion on audio files.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following packages:

- `SpeechRecognition`
- `IPython`
- `libportaudio2`

You can install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
sudo apt-get install libportaudio2
```
# Speech-to-Text Conversion

## Usage

1. Load the audio file:

```python
import IPython
IPython.display.Audio("path/to/your/audio/file.wav")
```
2. Initialize the Speech Recognizer:**

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
r = sr.Recognizer()
```
3. Convert speech to text:
```python
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    with sr.AudioFile(audio_file) as source:
        audio_text = r.listen(source)
        try:
            text = r.recognize_google(audio_text)
            print('Converting audio transcripts into text ...')
        except:
            print('Sorry.. run again...')
    
    return text

```
4. Call the ```python speech_to_text ``` function with the path to your audio file:
 ``` python
text = speech_to_text("path/to/your/audio/file.wav")
print(text)
```
